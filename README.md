There are 3 types of recommendation systems
Content-based
Content-based filtering is a type of recommender system that attempts to guess what a user may like based on that user's activity. Content-based filtering makes recommendations by using keywords and attributes assigned to objects in a database (e.g., items in an online marketplace) and matching them to a user profile.
Collaborative
Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users.
It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. It looks at the items they like and combines them to create a ranked list of suggestions.
There are many ways to decide which users are similar and combine their choices to create a list of recommendations. This article will show you how to do that with Python.
Popularity
It is a type of recommendation system which works on the principle of popularity and or anything which is in trend. These systems check the product or movies which are in trend or are most popular among the users and directly recommend those.
